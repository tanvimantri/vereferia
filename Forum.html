                    <p>In this tutorial, I would like to share some of my experience in how to bind (fill) DataGridView control in Windows Forms (WinForms) Application using DataTable in C#.
                        Getting started 🚀
                        First, we need to create a new console application project “Database Creation” in Visual Studio, and choose Language “C#”. Then create a database of “employees” and inside that database create a table “ telephone”.
                        Add the following columns to your telephone table 📌
                        Sr.No
                        officer_name
                        designation
                        dept
                        ext_no
                        std_no
                        mobile_no
                        room_no
                        address
                        senior_no.
                        Insert the data into your respective table.</p>

                    <p>Let’s first look at what APIs are? API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Now, I know that sounds very complex and technical, but it just means an interface, or method/way, for two pieces of software to communicate.
                        Here’s an Example to Illustrate…
                        An API can be compared to your bank’s ATM (Automated Teller Machine).
                        Just like an API, banks will make them accessible so you can grab your balance, withdraw cash and make payments at your convenience.
                        Before you can do anything, though, you’ll need to authenticate ( use your card and put in your PIN) so the bank knows you’re authorized to transact.
                        Similarly, with an API, you’ll send a request to the system along with your authentication and, if you’re authorized, you’ll receive the data you requested — the cash money.</p>

                    <p>Like any other curious person, you must have wondered that what is the basic structure on which your Web Applications work. What is that structure? What it consists of? How does the entire thing make it possible for a user to get a response on any dynamic web page?
                        Let’s first understand, what happens when a client sends a request to the server
                        The request is sent to the Web Server by a client in the form of an HTTP request to get particular information or access a resource. Now, the Web Server accepts the request, processes the information, and sends back an HTTP response. While this process, the Web Application may interact with the Database or formulate a response. So, let’s see how the Architectural Patterns help.</p>

                    <p>Let us first understand what the parallax effect in general means. This is what Wikipedia says- “Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.”
                        This translates to web development as the difference between the displacement of the object placed in the foreground and background. In simpler words, parallax scrolling is a website trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.
                        Let see how to apply this concept to a website.</p>

                    <h4><a href="#">Transactions and ACID Properties(DBMS)</a></h4>
                    <p>What is a Transaction?
                        A database transaction is a logical unit of processing or a set of low-level tasks in a database management system (DBMS) that includes one or more database access operations. The transfer of money from one bank account to another is a simple example of a transaction.
                        While it may appear to be a simple two-step process, it involves a number of steps, including the creation of a bank account, debiting money from one account, crediting money to another account, and so on. It is impossible to double-check data accuracy before and after each transaction. So it’ll be taken care of by the ACID properties!
                        
                        What are ACID properties?
                        ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability which are the four key properties of a database transaction. These properties provide data integrity, consistency, and accuracy by maintaining the data in a correct and complete manner.</p>

                    <h4><a href="#">TSQL vs No-SQL</a></h4>
                    <p>SQL is a Structured Query Language. It is the most common language with easy syntax and is used for extracting and organizing data stored in the relational database. A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.
                        Now, let’s understand how SQL is used.
                        SQL allows users to handle data in the form of tables which consists of rows and columns. There are various SQL commands to do a variety of operations on a database such as ‘Select’, ‘Create’, ‘Drop’, ‘Delete’, ‘Update’, ‘Insert’ along with some in-built functions like MIN(), MAX(), COUNT(), SUM(), AVG().
                        SQL is used for most of the modern database management systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.</p>

                    </a></h4>
                    <p>If you want to learn OS, then the best way to start is Operating System by Tanenbaum.

                        You can do memory management, from Galvan. These are the books which are followed in all the tier 1 college in India. Regarding the road map, then follow the following method-
                        
                        Start from learning the basics, with Process Management. Learn process synchronisation then.
                        Study various forms of deadlocks and what are the ways a dead lock can be avoided. Its actually the most interesting topic in the whole unit. You will come to know various methods in which a possible obstacle could be avoided such that all processes do not run into conflict with each other. So deadlock is one of the most important topic as well. Just to make it more clear, imagine you and your girl friend ran into some conflict, a serious one, and neither you nor she is ready to speak first. Now what? she is thinking that you would make a call first and you are also thinking the same, both are waiting for each other’s text/call. But then, no one is ready to compromise the ego. So, in the same way, processes at time, run into serious complications and hence some serious conflicts occur inside our systems, and it is the duty of the operating system to resolve the conflict.
                        Then study memory management (also called as heart of the operating system) from Galvan, which is till date one of the best text book I have ever read. Its one of those books which have laid the foundation text of OS. Consider it as bible of OS. Focus on concepts of Virtual Memory, Belady’s anomaly and stack algorithms, segmentation, paging, page replacement algorithms.
                        Then comes file system, I/O and protection. This part is very important as well.
                        Prepare threads and system calls. Operating systems, without system calls seems like pizza without proper topping. It is actually incomplete without this topic.</p>

                    <h4><a href="#">Why should I prefer Java over Python?</a></h4>
                    <p>Maybe a slightly flippant answer: You should prefer Java over Python if you want to do the kind of work where Java is favoured.

                        Java is faster, with no global interpreter lock. If you’re building a massively growing social media network in python, then you’re going to run into some very serious performance boundaries, where the JVM would scale just fine
                        Java is statically typed. As your codebase grows, those types really help you with collaboration and ongoing maintenance. They allow the compiler to catch an entire new class of errors, and they allow for much better IDE assistance. Studies show that working on larger systems is faster in a statically-typed language… by almost exactly the amount of time that would otherwise be spent looking up valid inputs for parameters
                        Java has a larger ecosystem. If you want to work in an area where existing tools and frameworks are in Java, then Python won’t be your first choice!
                        Java is the language of choice for Android development. I not aware of any library for writing mobile apps in Python.
                        Many industries favour Java (for the above reasons). If you want to work in investment banking, with investment banking contract rates, then you’ll almost certainly be doing so in Java</p>

                    <h4><a href="#">What is the best programming language?</a></h4>
                    <p>Huge community, endless documentation, corporate backing, will run on any machine that someone who asked this question is likely to own. And it’s useful for solving problems you care about. Want to run your fantasy league? Balance your church’s books? Track your workouts? No problem. Want to go a bit deeper? There’s plenty there. And being an Excel wizard isn’t bad for your paycheck, either.

                        And once you start getting handy with writing larger and more complex macros, you’ll eventually hit problems that Excel doesn’t solve that well. At that point, come back and ask for programming language recommendations on how to solve that particular problem.
                        
                        Learning arbitrary programming languages without understanding the problems they were designed to solve is just an exercise in trivia memorization.</p>

                    <h4><a href="#">What is the road map to learn programming languages for a first year computer science and engineering student?</a></h4>
                    <p>Mastering any one area of programming is ridiculously hard work, requiring a depth of understanding that most would find tiresome to learn and the people that do it are only good programmers if they then push that knowledge into new places to make things more efficient or solve a problem nobody considered or everyone believed to be insurmountable. Only programmers that love their work have what it takes and predicting what area you're going to love most is especially difficult when you've yet to taste much of what there is out there on offer.

                        With that in mind, use the answers you gather here just to get you started and then every step along the way, when you find something that interests you to discover more about or push a little further, don't be afraid to take a potentially permanent diversion.
                        
                        To get you started, you first must appreciate there are many languages and subareas in programming. Most people end up working with the a language from the C family or Java as these are the most popular across the world. They are most popular because they are extremely powerful, general tools and there exists a library for almost any purpose imaginable.</p>

                    <h4><a href="#">How do I start learning artificial intelligence? Is it possible to get research work in the field of A.I? Are there open source projects where I can contribute?</a></h4>
                    <p>If you are interested in AI because you wish to make a career in the area then you need to make the up-front decision of whether you're interested in philosophy, neuroscience or machine learning.

                        For the former I would recommend starting out with essays by Dennett, Boden and Turing. Here's a relevant answer: I have read the Jaegwon Kim "Philosophy of Mind". What are other notable manuals?
                        
                        If you are interested in the neuroscience then there's a computational neuro course online Computational Neuroscience that can get you started. Here's a relevant answer: How can I get into computational neuroscience if I have a B.S. in neuroscience and am proficient in Python?
                        
                        For machine learning, my personal area of interest, a good set of material references can be found at: How do I learn machine learning?
                        
                        Obviously you can choose to dip into all three of those areas as you wish and settle on one which interests you the most, this is what I did during my undergrad.</p>
